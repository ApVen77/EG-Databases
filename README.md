# EG-Databases

## Class Project 

## An outline of Databases. 

Introduces the fundamental concepts
necessary for designing, using, and implementing
database systems and database applications. Our presentation stresses the fundamentals of database modeling and design, the languages and models provided by the
database management systems, and database system implementation techniques.
The book is meant to be used as a textbook for a one- or two-semester course in
database systems at the junior, senior, or graduate level, and as a reference book. Our
goal is to provide an in-depth and up-to-date presentation of the most important
aspects of database systems and applications, and related technologies. We assume
that readers are familiar with elementary programming and data-structuring concepts and that they have had some exposure to the basics of computer organization
